**QUESTIONS**
1) Should lightbox be black for videos / green for forms and other elements?
2) Mailchimp account already setup?
3) Should forms be e-mailed to anyone? *I'm using a built-in perch form to store all of the entries into a database so you'll easily be able to get that info from the backend + send to mailchimp.
4) Do you want navigation arrows for the screen partners carousel? or should it scroll through automatically?
5) I purchased a Perch license... would you guys like to purchase one separately or reimburse me? I can re-use this license for my own projects, as I'll definitely be using this Perch often, so either works for me.
